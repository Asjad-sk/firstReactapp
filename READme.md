# Welcome to my first react-web
This web consist of two app 

 1.  **Weather** 2.**Todo**

the stack used in this project is **MERN**
the data's of todo is fetching from mongodb and 
also used **react-redux-toolkit** 

There are some issues in 
code in css instead of storing css in variable and use,
i directly write css on style attribute but it doesn't affect any thing just the line of code's are increases

**for installation "npm i"**
